# My-terraform-scripts
This repository contains my learnings and implmentations of  various terraform scripts I have written. 
I am using EC2 instance as my terraform host machine and configuring to gain access to  manage AWS resources .

**Prerequisites:**
You will need to configure EC2 instance with aws configure so that it connects terraform to that specific AWS account .
